Project with backtrack. Put tetrominoes in the smallest possible square.

The program receives a file with Tetris figures (Tetrimino), checks them for validity and cuts them off. Then, using the backtrack algorithm, it collects them into the smallest square in which the figures can fit. At the exit, the figures are named with latin letters in the order of their location in the file.
